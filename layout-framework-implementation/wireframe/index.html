        <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        <p>I probably went too far beyond a basic wireframe and layout, but I had time to do more and get a more detailed layout.</p>
        <p>Normally I would begin with mobile, but I decided to start with Desktop as it seems like the most common screen type for users
            of WebSTAC. <br> The layout is largely based on dashboard-items which makes it easy to transition to mobile as I can stack and resize them.
            <br> As for the tables, there are several different ways I plan on resizing the information to fit on mobile. <br> In addition, the navigation drawer will
            become hidden and viewable with a menu button on mobile.
        </p>

        <p>These designs are created on a 12 column grid that I scaled down to 8 columns and 4 columns for tablet and mobile respectively.<br> The cards are also aligned to the grid so it is easy to scale for all sizes.</p>
